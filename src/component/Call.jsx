Should authors be requested by the editor to revise the text, the revised version should be submitted within 1 month. Authors who need more time are kindly requested to contact the Editor. The Editor reserves the right to reject a paper if it does not meet the aims and scope of the journal, it is not technically sound, it is not revised satisfactorily, or if it is inadequate in presentation.
             <h3>Revised and Final Version:</h3>
